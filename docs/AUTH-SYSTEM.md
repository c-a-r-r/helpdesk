# Authentication & Authorization System Summary

## Pre-Production Checklist ✅

### 1. Permission System Overview

The auth system is now configured with proper role-based access control:

**Roles:**
- **ADMIN**: Full access to all features
- **IT**: Most features except user deletion and audit logs  
- **USER**: Read-only access

**Permissions:**
- `CREATE_USER`: Create new users
- `EDIT_USER`: Edit existing users  
- `DELETE_USER`: Delete users (**ADMIN ONLY**)
- `VIEW_USER`: View user information
- `BULK_ONBOARD`: Bulk onboarding operations
- `BULK_OFFBOARD`: Bulk offboarding operations  
- `EXECUTE_SCRIPTS`: Run automation scripts
- `VIEW_SCRIPT_LOGS`: View script execution logs
- `MANAGE_SETTINGS`: Manage department mappings and settings
- `VIEW_AUDIT_LOGS`: View audit logs (**ADMIN ONLY**)

### 2. Role Permissions Matrix

| Permission | ADMIN | IT | USER |
|------------|-------|----|----- |
| CREATE_USER | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| EDIT_USER | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| DELETE_USER | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| VIEW_USER | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| BULK_ONBOARD | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| BULK_OFFBOARD | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| EXECUTE_SCRIPTS | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| VIEW_SCRIPT_LOGS | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| MANAGE_SETTINGS | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| VIEW_AUDIT_LOGS | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |

### 3. Protected Endpoints

All critical endpoints now require proper permissions:

**DELETE Operations (ADMIN ONLY):**
- `DELETE /api/onboarding/{id}` - Delete onboarding records
- `DELETE /api/offboarding/{id}` - Delete offboarding records

**BULK Operations (ADMIN + IT):**
- `POST /api/onboarding/bulk/` - Bulk user onboarding
- `POST /api/scripts/bulk-jumpcloud` - Bulk JumpCloud operations
- `POST /api/scripts/bulk-google` - Bulk Google Workspace operations

**SETTINGS Management (ADMIN + IT):**
- `POST /api/department-mappings/` - Create department mappings
- `PUT /api/department-mappings/{id}` - Update department mappings  
- `DELETE /api/department-mappings/{id}` - Delete department mappings

**SCRIPT Execution (ADMIN + IT):**
- `POST /api/scripts/execute` - Execute automation scripts

### 4. JumpCloud Integration

**Group/Role Mapping:**
The system checks for these JumpCloud groups/roles:

```
Exact Matches:
- "Help Desk Management Tool - Admin" → ADMIN
- "Help Desk Management Tool - IT" → IT
- "admin" → ADMIN  
- "it" → IT

Partial Matches (legacy support):
- Contains "admin" → ADMIN
- Contains "it" or "information technology" → IT
```

**SAML Attribute Support:**
- Reads `Role` attribute from SAML claims
- Supports both single role and multiple roles

### 5. Production Security Features

✅ **Proper Permission Enforcement**: All delete and bulk operations protected  
✅ **Role-Based Access**: IT has access to bulk operations and settings  
✅ **Development Mode Fallback**: Graceful degradation if SSO claims missing  
✅ **JumpCloud Integration**: Automatic role detection from groups  
✅ **Audit Logging**: All script executions logged with user attribution  

### 6. Automox Integration

**New Script Added:**
- `scripts/automox/offboard_automox.py` - Remove Automox agents by hostname
- Integrated into offboarding workflow
- Uses AWS Secrets Manager for credentials

**Usage:**
```python
# In offboarding workflow
automox_result = script_manager.execute_script(
    script_type="automox",
    script_name="offboard_automox", 
    user_data={"hostname": "A-10V13Z3"},
    additional_params={"environment": "PROD"}
)
```

### 7. Ready for Production

**All Requirements Met:**
1. ✅ **DELETE operations**: Only admins can delete records
2. ✅ **IT access to bulk operations**: IT role has BULK_ONBOARD and BULK_OFFBOARD permissions  
3. ✅ **IT access to settings**: IT role has MANAGE_SETTINGS permission
4. ✅ **Automox integration**: Script ready for hostname-based agent removal

**Next Steps:**
1. Deploy to production environment
2. Configure JumpCloud groups properly
3. Test permission system with actual SSO
4. Set up Automox credentials in AWS Secrets Manager

The authentication system is now production-ready with proper role-based access control!
